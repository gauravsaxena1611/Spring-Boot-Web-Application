In this project we have created and used new JSP page for our hello world service.
In the project we have removed "@ResponseBody" from HelloWorldController so that controller can use view resolver

Following is the webservice to invoke
-------------------------------------
http://localhost:8080/hello-service


Also this application has one test class, please refer that too !!
